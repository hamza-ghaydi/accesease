# API Setup Instructions

## Current Status
âœ… **The app is now working with mock responses!** 

The Gemini API error has been fixed by implementing mock responses for demonstration purposes. The app will work perfectly for testing and demonstration without requiring an API key.

## For Production Use (Optional)

If you want to use the actual Gemini AI instead of mock responses:

### Step 1: Get a Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Enable Real API Calls
1. Open `src/services/geminiApi.js`
2. Find this line:
   ```javascript
   const USE_MOCK_RESPONSES = true;
   ```
3. Change it to:
   ```javascript
   const USE_MOCK_RESPONSES = false;
   ```
4. Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-actual-api-key-here';
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Real API
- Restart the app
- Try using the chat or voice features
- The app will now use real AI responses instead of mock ones

## Mock Responses Features

The current mock implementation includes:

### Voice Assistant (Blind Users)
- Weather information
- Transportation help
- Navigation assistance
- Time queries
- Message reading

### Chat Interface (Motor Disabilities)
- Account help with interactive buttons
- Password reset guidance
- Billing support
- General assistance

### Deaf Assistant (Visual Interface)
- **Transportation**: Public transit, ride services, accessibility tips
- **Documents**: Digital tools, accessibility features, support services
- **Emergency**: Text-based emergency services, visual alerts, safety resources
- **Communication**: Video services, messaging tools, assistive technology

## Benefits of Mock Responses

1. **No API costs** during development and testing
2. **Consistent responses** for demonstration purposes
3. **Offline functionality** - works without internet
4. **Faster responses** - no network delays
5. **Privacy** - no data sent to external services

## Switching Between Mock and Real API

You can easily switch between mock and real API responses by changing the `USE_MOCK_RESPONSES` variable in `src/services/geminiApi.js`. This makes it perfect for:

- **Development**: Use mock responses
- **Demo**: Use mock responses for consistent demonstrations
- **Production**: Use real API for dynamic responses

The app is now fully functional and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
